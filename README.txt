Just a quick extension that takes any Comic Sans MS font on a website and changes it to a normal Sans Serif font. Giving Credit where credt is due, I borrowed a lot of the code from Comic Sans Replacer by niu tech. Their's changes font from Comic Sans to Comic Neuve and I highly suggest checking it out as well
